- I was unemployed in 2021 thanks to covid so i took hold of my dream to become a frontend dev. <br>
Between June and November Angela yu's [Udemy Courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)
taught me the basics of web development. <br> 
Now, well now i code as much as i can so when the time comes for me to start my career as a frontend dev <br>
a have some knowledge in the things i will work with.


- I always have this thing in me when a problem comes or i do not know about something, i want to fix it or know more about it. :book:


- I'm an trained electrician :electric_plug: and worked as an electrician for about 8 years, and as an electrician you work with new things and have <br>
to addapt fast. I was usually given the tasks to solve problems on construction site I was working on and i kinda liked it <br>
it taught me alot and i'm grateful about that.
